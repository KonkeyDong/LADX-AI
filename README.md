## (THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS AND WILL BE UPDATED WHENEVER I FEEL LIKE UPDATING)

## Stack
- [BizHawk](http://tasvideos.org/Bizhawk/ReleaseHistory.html#Bizhawk24) - (Latest version should work.) Follow the install at the top of the page.
    - Only appears to work on windows. If you can get to work on Linux, let me know how.
- ROM Files
    - I won't post where I found my ROM files. You can verify that you're using the same ROM as me using `md5sum`:
        - `07c211479386825042efb4ad31bb525f` - USA, Europe version
        - `f75874e3654360094fc2b09bd1fed7e8` - Japan 1.0 version

# Use
Dump .lua files into BizHawk while running LADX. The program should open a separate window. Change the bools in `settings.lua` to display different overlays. You may need to stretch your Emulator to display information on bezles instead of the game itself.
